# 🧠 AI-Enhanced Linked List Visualizer (Java Swing)

## 📋 Project Overview
The **AI-Enhanced Linked List Visualizer** is a robust desktop application built in Java Swing that provides a comprehensive, interactive, and intelligent platform for learning fundamental Linked List Data Structures. Beyond simple visualization, the project features a **custom Machine Learning (ML) Predictor** to analyze user behavior and suggest the most probable next operation, demonstrating a strong integration of DSA fundamentals with AI concepts.

## ✨ Features

### 🎯 Multi-Modal DSA
- **Full implementation** and visualization for **Singly, Doubly, and Circular Linked Lists**
- **Real-time animated manipulation** of nodes and pointers for all operations
- **Comprehensive operations**: Insert, Delete, Reverse, Search, Clear

### 🤖 Custom AI/ML Integration
- **Smart Predictor** built from scratch using **Transition Matrix approach**
- **Dynamic operation anticipation** with confidence scoring
- **Personalized learning** through behavior pattern analysis

### 🎨 Modern UI/UX
- **Clean, engaging dark-mode interface** built purely with Java Swing
- **Responsive design** with smooth animations
- **Color-coded operations** for intuitive user experience

### 🔄 How It Works
```java
// Tracks user operation sequences
INSERT_START → INSERT_END → SEARCH → DELETE_VALUE
